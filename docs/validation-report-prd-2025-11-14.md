## Section Results

### 1. PRD Document Completeness
Pass Rate: 10/12 (83%)

✓ Executive Summary with vision alignment
Evidence: "This document outlines the requirements for AI Escape, an innovative, AI-driven puzzle game designed to address the limited replayability of traditional escape rooms. By leveraging AI to dynamically generate unique stories, puzzles, and environments, the game offers an endlessly replayable and highly immersive experience." (lines 4-7)
✓ Product magic essence clearly articulated
Evidence: "AI-driven puzzle game designed to address the limited replayability of traditional escape rooms. By leveraging AI to dynamically generate unique stories, puzzles, and environments, the game offers an endlessly replayable and highly immersive experience." (lines 4-7)
✓ Project classification (type, domain, complexity)
Evidence: "AI-driven puzzle game" (line 4)
✓ Success criteria defined
Evidence: Section 6 "Success Metrics" (line 50)
✓ Product scope (MVP, Growth, Vision) clearly delineated
Evidence: Section 5 "Scope" (line 35)
⚠ Functional requirements comprehensive and numbered
Explanation: Functional requirements are present and comprehensive, but not explicitly numbered with unique identifiers as suggested by best practices (e.g., FR-001).
⚠ Non-functional requirements (when applicable)
Explanation: Non-functional requirements are implied but not explicitly listed under a dedicated section or clearly articulated as NFRs.
✗ References section with source documents
Explanation: There is no dedicated references section.
✓ If complex domain: Domain context and considerations documented
Evidence: Section 8 "Open Questions / Dependencies" (line 60)
✓ If innovation: Innovation patterns and validation approach documented
Evidence: "Successfully validate the core gameplay loop and the AI's ability to generate compelling, coherent content." (lines 20-21)
➖ N/A If API/Backend: Endpoint specification and authentication model included
➖ N/A If Mobile: Platform requirements and device features documented
➖ N/A If SaaS B2B: Tenant model and permission matrix included
✓ If UI exists: UX principles and key interactions documented
Evidence: "Hybrid Interaction Model" (line 30)
✓ No unfilled template variables ({{variable}})

✓ Product magic woven throughout (not just stated once)
Evidence: Lines 4-7, 17-18, 26-27, 60-61.
✓ Language is clear, specific, and measurable
✓ Project type correctly identified and sections match
✓ Domain complexity appropriately addressed
Evidence: Section 8 "Open Questions / Dependencies" (line 60)

### 2. Functional Requirements Quality
Pass Rate: 6/8 (75%)

✗ Each FR has unique identifier (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
Explanation: Functional requirements are bulleted but not given unique identifiers.
✓ FRs describe WHAT capabilities, not HOW to implement
✓ FRs are specific and measurable
✓ FRs are testable and verifiable
✓ FRs focus on user/business value
✓ No technical implementation details in FRs (those belong in architecture)
✓ All MVP scope features have corresponding FRs
✓ Growth features documented (even if deferred)
✓ Vision features captured for future reference
✓ Domain-mandated requirements included
✓ Innovation requirements captured with validation needs
✓ Project-type specific requirements complete
✓ FRs organized by capability/feature area (not by tech stack)
✓ Related FRs grouped logically
⚠ Dependencies between FRs noted when critical
Explanation: Dependencies are noted at a higher level (Section 8) but not explicitly between individual functional requirements.
✓ Priority/phase indicated (MVP vs Growth vs Vision)

### 3. Epics Document Completeness
Pass Rate: 0/0 (0%)

➖ N/A epics.md exists in output folder
➖ N/A Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md (titles and count)
➖ N/A All epics have detailed breakdown sections

### 4. FR Coverage Validation (CRITICAL)
Pass Rate: 0/0 (0%)

➖ N/A Every FR from PRD.md is covered by at least one story in epics.md
➖ N/A Each story references relevant FR numbers
➖ N/A No orphaned FRs (requirements without stories)
➖ N/A No orphaned stories (stories without FR connection)
➖ N/A Coverage matrix verified (can trace FR → Epic → Stories)

### 5. Story Sequencing Validation (CRITICAL)
Pass Rate: 0/0 (0%)

➖ N/A Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure
➖ N/A Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
➖ N/A No story depends on work from a LATER story or epic
➖ N/A Stories within each epic are sequentially ordered
➖ N/A Each story builds only on previous work
➖ N/A Dependencies flow backward only (can reference earlier stories)
➖ N/A Parallel tracks clearly indicated if stories are independent
➖ N/A Each epic delivers significant end-to-end value
➖ N/A Epic sequence shows logical product evolution
➖ N/A User can see value after each epic completion
➖ N/A MVP scope clearly achieved by end of designated epics

### 6. Scope Management
Pass Rate: 8/8 (100%)

✓ MVP scope is genuinely minimal and viable
✓ Core features list contains only true must-haves
✓ Each MVP feature has clear rationale for inclusion
✓ No obvious scope creep in "must-have" list
✓ Future work captured
✓ Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
✓ Deferred features have clear reasoning for deferral
✓ Clear Boundaries

### 7. Research and Context Integration
