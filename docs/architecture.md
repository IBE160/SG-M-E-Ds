# Architecture

## Executive Summary

The "AI Escape" project is an AI-driven puzzle game designed for high replayability, offering dynamically generated stories and puzzles. Key objectives include addressing limited replayability of traditional escape rooms and providing an immersive, customizable experience. The project encompasses 5 epics and 12 user stories, with a strong focus on a retro-futuristic UI, responsive design, and WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility. A primary architectural challenge is ensuring the coherence and logical consistency of AI-generated content.
