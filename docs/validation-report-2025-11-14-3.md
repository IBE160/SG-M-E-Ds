## Failed Items
- **ux-color-themes.html** only shows one theme instead of 3-4.
- **ux-design-directions.html** does not have a responsive preview toggle.
- **Color accessibility (contrast ratios)** has not been fully tested.
- **Typography details (font weights, line heights)** are missing.

## Partial Items

## Recommendations
1.  **Must Fix:**
    -   Perform a full accessibility review, including color contrast checks and keyboard navigation testing.
    -   Define the remaining typography details (font weights, line heights).
    -   Define the container widths for different breakpoints.
    -   Explicitly define the visual hierarchy and interaction patterns.
    -   Perform the Cross-Workflow Alignment with the `epics.md` file.
2.  **Should Improve:**
    -   Add 1-3 more design directions to `ux-design-directions.html` to meet the 6-8 recommendation.
    -   Add more theme options to `ux-color-themes.html` to enable side-by-side comparison.
3.  **Consider:**
    -   Adding a responsive preview toggle to `ux-design-directions.html`.
