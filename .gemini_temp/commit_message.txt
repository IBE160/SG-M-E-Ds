feat: Implement core game logic and interaction for stories 1-1 to 1-5

This commit addresses the development of the backend for the AI Escape game across five stories.
It includes project initialization, game state management, hard-coded room and puzzle implementation,
the core interaction model, and basic visual data handling for rooms.

Detailed changes per story:

- **Story 1.1 (Project Initialization):**
  - Initialized Flask project structure (venv, basic directories, .env).
  - Implemented "Hello World" route in app.py.
  - Configured GitHub Actions CI for Python.
  - Set up setup.cfg for Flake8 and conftest.py for Pytest.
  - Ensured all unit/integration tests for project structure and basic app functionality pass.

- **Story 1.2 (Game State Management):**
  - Verified existing GameSession model and SQLAlchemy configuration.
  - Confirmed existing CRUD operations for GameSession in game_logic.py.
  - Verified existing Flask routes for GameSession updates (move, inventory).
  - Ensured all unit/integration tests for game state management pass.

- **Story 1.3 (Static Hard-coded Escape Room):**
  - Designed a 3-room sequence and two distinct puzzles.
  - Implemented hard-coded room and puzzle data in ai-escape-app/data/rooms.py.
  - Added solve_puzzle logic in game_logic.py and a new solve_puzzle_route.
  - Modified move_player logic to handle room transitions based on ROOM_DATA and trigger game escape.
  - Created test_rooms_data.py for unit tests and updated test_app.py for integration tests, including test_game_escape.

- **Story 1.4 (Core Interaction Model):**
  - Implemented get_contextual_options in game_logic.py for dynamic interaction lists.
  - Modified get_session route to return contextual_options.
  - Created interact route to process player choices (Look around, Go, Solve, Go back).
  - Implemented "Go back" functionality using game_history.
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for the interact route.

- **Story 1.5 (Basic Visuals for Rooms):**
  - Created ai-escape-app/static/images/ and placeholder image files for rooms.
  - Mapped room IDs to image assets in ai-escape-app/data/rooms.py.
  - Modified get_session route to return current_room_image, name, and description.
  - Added unit tests for image mapping and updated integration tests for get_session response.

All tests are passing, and linting/formatting is compliant.
